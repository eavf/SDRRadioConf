# SDRRadioConf

This is my base configuration for HackRF One

Consisting of:
- HackRF tools and library as on june 2023 - build from source
- I have decided to exclude gr-osmosdr on the base of the avertissement at GNU Radio Compagnion and going to use Soapy blocks for my HackRF
- Finnally - installation of the GNU Radio from its ppa
